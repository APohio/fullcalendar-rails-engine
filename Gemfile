# FIXME: Please Remove Gemfile.lock of engine from VCS. [fixed]

# FIXME: Can we remove this line? This is because, when the engine is mounted, and the bundle is run on the host app, we would be hitting the rubygems multiple times.[fixed]

# Declare your gem's dependencies in fullcalendar_engine.gemspec.
# Bundler will treat runtime dependencies like base dependencies, and
# development dependencies will be added by default to the :development group.
gemspec
# Declare any dependencies that are still in development here instead of in
# your gemspec. These might include edge Rails or gems from your path or
# Git. Remember to move these dependencies to your gemspec before releasing
# your gem to rubygems.org.

# To use debugger
# gem 'debugger'
